# BIGFOOT CENTRAL

If you're anything like me, everytime to take a fresh breath of air and a fresh gander at some tree-infested patch of earth playing host to moth dance recitals, you think, "Where the hell's all the bigfoots?"

So, like any good coon dog of the modern age, I took to the Google and sussed out where the furry buds like to hang their callused namesakes. Turns out they turn up all sorts of places, often blurred, which suggests either a gravimetric field or a generally mushy aesthetic. 

I'm not often described as sentimental, but...well, I was awestruck by the beauty of these fuzz buds. I felt something inside drip into something else. Like separatin' egg whites form yolks. And this glowin' yolk inside'a me steered me to making a tribute best I could.

**B-Foot Central** was my first project for my [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) studies. I put that sucker out into the everlasting web so that these blanketed beauts may live forever in glory. I'm no 'puter expert, so there's plentya people who could make something better, but I'm all I got so I gave it my best. Don't imagine there'll be much remixin' on this thing, but you're free to if you'd like.
